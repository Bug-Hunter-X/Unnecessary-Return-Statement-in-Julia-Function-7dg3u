# Unnecessary Return Statement Bug in Julia

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in Julia: an unnecessary `return` statement within a function that already has a complete set of `if-elseif-else` blocks.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially mask other logic errors.

The bug is in `bug.jl`, where the function `myfunction` includes a final `return 1` statement. This statement is unreachable and can cause unexpected results, particularly if future modifications alter the function's logic.
